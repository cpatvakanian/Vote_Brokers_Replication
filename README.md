# Vote Brokers Replication

This repo contains files for my Gov1006 replication project of Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019). In this project, 
I was sucessfully able to replicate their findings and provide an extension of their research by impuring missing
values in their data.

The file "Replication.pdf" is my PDF replication paper and extension for this project.

The file "Replication.Rmd" contains the R markdown file I used to replicate the paper and conduct my extension.

The folder "images" contains the various images I used in my Rmd as part of the replication and extension.

The "data" folder contains all of the data and code provided by the authors in the [Frye, Reuter and Szakony Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YSVMS2).

The original paper written by Frye, Reuter and Szakony can be found online at the [Cambridge University Press Website](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/vote-brokers-clientelist-appeals-and-voter-turnout-evidence-from-russia-and-venezuela/45FE0BE1216FCD8744B02A82919B328A).

The "bib.bib" file has the citations I used for my paper.
