# Vote Brokers Replication

This repo contains files for my Gov1006 replication project of Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019). In this project, 
I was sucessfully able to replicate their findings and provide an extension of their research by impuring missing
values in their data.

The file "Replication.Rmd" contains the R markdown file I used to replicate the paper and conduct my extension.

The folder "images" contains the various images I used in my Rmd as part of the replication and extension.

The "data" folder contains all of the data I used for this project and is from the [Frye, Reuter and Szakony(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YSVMS2)
