# Introduction

I am replicating "Vote Brokers, Clientelist Appeals, and Voter Turnout: Evidence from Russia and Venezuela" by Timothy Frye, Ora John Reuter and David Szakonyi.[^1] The authors use survey-based framework experiments conducted in Russia and Venezuela to analyze voter patterns and turnout in both countries respectively. Their main finding is that there is higher voter turnout after a voter has been induced by an employer as opposed to a party activist. The results are consistent in both Venezuela and Russia, and are also consistent with existing literature on voter turnout, such as Mares and Young (2016), who also find that employer intimidation significantly influences voter turnout. The data are rich and from face to face interviews in both Russia and Venezuela, with the Venezuelan data coming from a stratified sample whereas the Russian from 20 regions. Thus, it appears that the Venezuelan data is a more representative than the Russian. However, I believe due to the random sampling and oversampling, the Russian data is still an accurate representation of Russian voters. The models used in the paper include using difference in means between brokers and between inducements, predicted probabilities from individual ordered logit regressions on respondents’ likelihood of voting in the survey experiment, and fixed effect linear regressions using interaction variables on willingness to vote.

I was able to successfully replicate the paper using the software of @Rbaby. The source of the data and code used for this replication was generously provided online at the authors' publicly accessible Dataverse.[^2] The repo with my replication code and data can be found on GitHub at the link provided in the footnote. [^3]

For my extension of this paper, I decided to look at the missing values in this dataset. Given that the treatment assignment was random for all participants, it seemed unlikely that the missing values the data would likely lead to any to any bias. However, as a robustness check, it is still an important contribution to ensure that the results we see are not due to potential sample bias in either country and that the data truly are missing at random. After imputing data using multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE), I was able to create multiple imputations or replacement values, for the gaps in the data. After running similar regressions provided in Table 3, I find results consistent with paper's originally findings, with some regressions' coefficients becoming slightly higher or lower in magitude.

# Literature Review

The findings of Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019) appear to generally follow what is in the literature. In @aslund_2012, Aslund suggests that in many post soviet countries, voting patterns were heavily influenced by the transition to democracy in institutions built. In Russia, the case was that there was not enough a big push to transform after communism, and thus the country had to face more difficulties in long term in ensuring fair and free elections due to potential voter interference and corruption on all levels. Similarly, @popova finds that controlling for different employment statuses and corruption, people are stil likely to vote differently, and more corruption generally induces people to vote more.

Regarding the literature on Venezuela, @Jimenez too find that there is evidence for significant voter interference in voting in the country through "voter rigging". In addition, @Jimenez draw parallels in this study to the types of voter manipulation rampant in Russia. @stokes also find that voter fraud is indeed a large problem in Venezuela, and given the extent of information aviable party activists, who for example are able to access a large portion of individual voter history and tendencies, voter intimidation through party activists has become a significant issue in the country. 

Additionally, other areas of literature focuses on the impact of violence on voting outcomes. In the African context, specifically sub-Saharan African nation of Kenya, @bekoe_burchard_2017 finds that threats to ones life have been used throughout the country to suppress voter turnout, though on aggregate they do not see an effect. Something which is less prevalent in the literature in most contexts, including  both Russia and Venezuela, is the influence of employers on voter turnout in these countries. Some of the latest research, presented in @mares, finds that employer intimidation significantly influences voter turnout, which closely matches the findings of Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019). 

# Replication

I was able to replicate all of the figures and the regression table provided in the paper based on the authors' provided data and code. There are minor visual differences, but all of the regression and and table values exactly match those provided in Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019). In the appendix, I provide one example of successful replication of Table 3 from the original paper. The replications of the other key figures and regression tables can be found in my code.  

# Extension

For my extension, I decided to look at missing data in the data sets and use multiple imputation to examine the robustness of the regressions found in Table 3. For my data imputation, I follow the DataScience+ article "Data Management in R Imputing Missing Data with R; MICE package".[^4] I choose to use the predictive mean matching method (pmm), which fills in the missing value using a random selection from existing observed "donor values" of other observations in the dataset whose regression-predicted values are closest to the regression-predicted value for the missing observation from the simulated regression model @newtest. Looking at the original data, there do not appear to be too many missing values, at most slightly over 30% for two variables, and only 18 out of the 49 variables in the data have any missing data all. I show the missing data below for the sample as a whole generally, and also for the breakdown per type of broker.

Given that the regression I am using for my extension, Figure 2 (which can be found in the appendix), uses only data from Russia, I decided to impute the missing values for Russia using the mice() function and re-run the regressions. I use the standard 5 iterations to gain 5 data sets of imputed data, and pool the results to get the final coefficients I would like to use for my model. In Figure 1, I show the density plots for the imputed data as a check to see whether or not the data I have imputed matches the existing values in the data set. It appears that the imputed data generally appear in line with the existing data set, which indicates that the data imputation is valid. Finally, in Table 2, which can be found in the appendix, I present the results of re-running the regressions using the newly imputed data.

When I take my results with the imputed data in Table 2 and compare it those of the original study, I find the same significance and sign of the coefficients, however the magnitude of the coefficients appears to differ only very slightly. I think that this just shows the original study is valid and robust, and by being able to not only replicate the data but get very similar results to the original after imputing data, I feel even more confident in the authors' findings.

# Conclusion

In this paper, I was successfully able to replicate all of the results of @frye_reuter_szakonyi_2019. As a robustness test, I decided to use multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) to create multiple imputations or replacement values for the gaps in the data. After running similar regressions provided in Table 3, I find results consistent with paper’s originally findings, with some regressions’ coefficients becoming slightly higher or lower in magnitude. These results confirm the authors’ original findings and suggest that the missing values in their sampled population do not bias the results. The implications of this replication and extension are that future studies in this area can build on these existing results and have confidence that the findings of Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019) are in fact robust.

# Appendix

The results from Frye, Reuter and Szakony (2019) were successfully replicated. As an example, here is Table 3 from page 735. Below I have included my replication, which differs only slightly in terms of table presentation and order of regressions. Those are only minor visual differences which do not take away from the otherwise successful replication of the analysis conducted using the authors' provided code. Further replication of the paper's key graphics and models can be inspected in the RMD file of my code available on the author's GitHub.[^5]

Below I have also included Table 2, which uses the imputed data to replicate the study's original Table 3.
